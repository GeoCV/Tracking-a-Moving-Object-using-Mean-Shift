To run the code:
1. copy the car, toy sequence images into the current folder of code
2. Change the MATLAB presenet working directory (pwd) to current folder.
3. For gray-scale tracking :
	run Mean_Shift_Tracking.m - for tracking without scale
	run Mean_Shift_Tracking_scale.m - for tracking with scale
4. For color tracking
	run Mean_Shift_Tracking_color  (Not getting good tracking!!!)

Cheers!
